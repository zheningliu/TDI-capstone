## The Data Incubator Capstone Project

This project is about making earnings forecast prediction in the stock market. The final product is a web page that given user input ticker and date, the actual earnings vs. forecasted earning should be displayed.

### Data

- quarterly eanrings data from public companies
- news scrapped from the Wall Street Journal

### How the HTML page works

- Enter Ticker, i.e. AAPL
- Enter Date of interest, and the program will convert it to its associated accounting period
- Submit the form will give the actual surprise if the date was in the past, the forecast surprise from the algorithm, and news headlines for reference
